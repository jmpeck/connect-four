(Original logic by Bryan Braun)

To run app:

1. Go to root directory of project
2. Run ‘npm install’ to install necessary packages
3. Run ‘mongod’ to start mongo service
4. Run ‘npm start’ to begin the app server process
5 Open a localhost windows to the port (3030) it’s running on

The table of winners lets the user see the outcomes of past games. The edit button opens an edit form below through which the user can edit the names of the players and the winner. The delete button performs a soft delete on the entry and removes it from the page. The review button allows the user to see what the final board looked like for the chosen game.

The logic for the connect four game comes from Byran Braun, whose game can be found here: http://bryanbraun.github.io/connect-four

I added the back end, winner table and edit forms. I also added some styling changes.

My apologies for the confusing function names. The app initially recorded every “move” a player made, but I decided to focus on final game states for the Code Louisville deadline.
